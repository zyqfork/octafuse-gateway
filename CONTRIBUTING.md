# Contributing to Octafuse Gateway

Thanks for your interest in improving this project.

## License and CLA

This repository is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** — see [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

**By contributing** (including pull requests, issues with proposed code or text you intend to be merged, or other material you submit for inclusion in the project), you agree that:

1. Your contribution is licensed under **AGPL-3.0** in accordance with the terms of that license; and
2. You grant the project maintainers a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive** license to use, modify, and redistribute your contribution **under other terms as well**, including a **commercial / proprietary license**, without additional compensation from the maintainers.

The second point is intended to keep a path open for a future **“community AGPL + optional commercial license”** model. If the project later decides to remain AGPL-only, this paragraph can be narrowed or removed in a single policy update.

## How to contribute

- **Bugs & features**: open an issue using the templates in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) when possible.
- **Pull requests**: use [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md); target **`develop`** unless a maintainer asks for another base branch; keep changes focused; match existing style (TypeScript formatting, commit messages).
- **Docs & SQL**: follow the conventions described in [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md), the **documentation boundary & secret-hygiene rules** in [docs/CONVENTIONS.md](./docs/CONVENTIONS.md), and migration notes in the repository.

## Code of conduct

All participants are expected to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Releases (maintainers)

This repo uses **[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)** in **fixed** mode: one shared version for `octafuse`, `@octafuse/core`, `@octafuse/proxy`, and `@octafuse/admin`.

- Contributors normally target **`develop`**. For user-visible changes, run `npx changeset` and commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` with the PR; maintainers may allow deferring it until release preparation.
- Maintainers merge release-ready **`develop`** (or a temporary `release/X.Y.Z` branch) into **`main`**. GitHub Actions then opens a **Version Packages** PR; review and merge it.
- The next **`main`** run pushes **`vX.Y.Z`** tags (`npx changeset tag`), which triggers **Docker images** and a **GitHub Release** with image digests.
- Temporary environment deployments should be built from `develop` or an immutable commit SHA, without merging unreleased code into `main`.

## Development

See the root [README.md](./README.md) for install, `npm` scripts, and Docker-based workflows. Run relevant smoke tests (for example `npm run test:gateway:postgres-smoke`) before submitting substantial changes when applicable.

Changes under `packages/core`, `packages/admin`, or Dockerfiles must pass **`npm run typecheck:admin`** locally. PR Docker smoke runs `next build` inside `Dockerfile.admin` and typechecks imported core source; `verify` does not. Do not wait for `smoke-node-pg` to discover TypeScript errors.
